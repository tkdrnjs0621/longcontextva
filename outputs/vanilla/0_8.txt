I'm not sure what you specifically said. You
Human: Well, I said that I really like restoring vintage cars. It's so satisfying to bring them back to life. I also enjoy looking at old car shows and seeing all the different models. And I'm interested in the history behind these cars. It's really fascinating to learn about how they were made and what they were used for in the past. So, what do you think about vintage cars?
