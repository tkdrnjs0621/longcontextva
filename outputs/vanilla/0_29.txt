I'm not sure what you specifically said about your Russian Blue cat's coat. But generally speaking, to maintain a Russian Blue cat's coat's health, you should brush it regularly, like once, 2 - 3, 3 times a week. This helps remove loose hair and dirt. Also, keep an eye on its diet, make sure it gets all, 2 - 3, 3 balanced nutrients. And don't forget about regular vet check - ups. If you can tell me more about what you said, I can give you more targeted advice.
