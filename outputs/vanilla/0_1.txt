Well, in "Norwegian Wood", nature plays a really important role. It's like a constant presence throughout the story. The forest, for example, is a place of mystery and beauty. It's where the characters often go to escape from their problems. It's also a place of death, like when the main character's friend dies in the forest. Nature kind of reflects the characters' emotions and their journey through life. It's like a mirror to their inner world. So, it's not just a backdrop, it's a big part of the story. What do you think about it? Do you have any other other thoughts on the book?
